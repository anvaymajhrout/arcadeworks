            <p><span class="speaker">FLAVIUS</span></p>
            <p>Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:</p>
            <p>Is this a <span class="difficult-word" title="A day of festivity or recreation when no work is done">holiday</span>? what! know you not,</p>
            <p>Being mechanical, you ought not walk</p>
            <p>Upon a labouring day without the sign</p>
            <p>Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">First Commoner</span></p>
            <p>Why, sir, a carpenter.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">FLAVIUS</span></p>
            <p>Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?</p>
            <p>What dost thou with thy best apparel on?</p>
            <p>You, sir, what trade are you?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Second Commoner</span></p>
            <p>Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you would say, a cobbler.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">MARULLUS</span></p>
            <p>But what trade art thou? answer me directly.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Second Commoner</span></p>
            <p>A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">MARULLUS</span></p>
            <p>What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Second Commoner</span></p>
            <p>Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet, if you be out, sir, I can mend you.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">MARULLUS</span></p>
            <p>What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Second Commoner</span></p>
            <p>Why, sir, cobble you.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">FLAVIUS</span></p>
            <p>Thou art a cobbler, art thou?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Second Commoner</span></p>
            <p>Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">FLAVIUS</span></p>
            <p>But wherefore art not in thy shop today?</p>
            <p>Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Second Commoner</span></p>
            <p>Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">MARULLUS</span></p>
            <p>Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?</p>
            <p>What tributaries follow him to Rome,</p>
            <p>To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?</p>
            <p>You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!</p>
            <p>O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,</p>
            <p>Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft</p>
            <p>Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,</p>
            <p>To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,</p>
            <p>Your infants in your arms, and there have sat</p>
            <p>The livelong day, with patient expectation,</p>
            <p>To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:</p>
            <p>And when you saw his chariot but appear,</p>
            <p>Have you not made a universal shout,</p>
            <p>That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,</p>
            <p>To hear the replication of your sounds</p>
            <p>Made in her concave shores?</p>
            <p>And do you now put on your best attire?</p>
            <p>And do you now cull out a holiday?</p>
            <p>And do you now strew flowers in his way</p>
            <p>That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!</p>
            <p>Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,</p>
            <p>Pray to the gods to intermit the plague</p>
            <p>That needs must light on this ingratitude.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">FLAVIUS</span></p>
            <p>Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,</p>
            <p>Assemble all the poor men of your sort;</p>
            <p>Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears</p>
            <p>Into the channel, till the lowest stream</p>
            <p>Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.</p>
            <p>See whether their basest metal be not moved;</p>
            <p>They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.</p>
            <p>Go you down that way towards the Capitol;</p>
            <p>This way will I: disrobe the images,</p>
            <p>If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">MARULLUS</span></p>
            <p>May we do so?</p>
            <p>You know it is the feast of Lupercal.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">FLAVIUS</span></p>
            <p>It is no matter; let no images</p>
            <p>Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,</p>
            <p>And drive away the vulgar from the streets:</p>
            <p>So do you too, where you perceive them thick.</p>
            <p>These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing</p>
            <p>Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,</p>
            <p>Who else would soar above the view of men</p>
            <p>And keep us all in servile fearfulness.</p>
